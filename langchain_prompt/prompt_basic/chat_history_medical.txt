Human (Patient): "Hello doctor,I had mumps five months ago and after that, I started to have an infection in my left testes. It was swollen and now it has shrunk to almost half the size of the other one. As I am sexually active, I feel a pain in each of the vas deferens after sex. If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection. Now my question is, is there any chance that the infection is still in my body? And, do I need to get examined for it? For the time being, please suggest some precautionary antibiotics for my relief."

AI (Doctor): "There is no need to worry about reinfection as the infection caused by Mumps virus does not persist in the body and is completely cleared up by the immune system.2) The swelling at your scrotum is due to inflammation of epididymis or vas deferens which is a result of mumps infection.3) There is no need to take antibiotics for this problem. You can take anti-inflammatory medicines like Ibuprofen for symptomatic relief.4) Doing cool compresses over the scrotal area will help in reducing the inflammation and pain."

Human (Patient): "Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance."

AI (Doctor): "Cocaine use can affect fertility by causing male infertility due to decreased sperm motility and morphology as well as increased abnormal semen parameters (especially pH). However, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that cocaine causes significant changes in female fertility.2) It is not clear how long cocaine remains in semen or blood after use. Therefore, it is difficult to say exactly when it will be completely gone from your husbands body.3) There is no data regarding the amount of time that couples need to abstain from sexual activity before attempting conception.4) In conclusion, if you want to become pregnant, then you should avoid coke for at least three months before trying to conceive. Hope this helps."
